These are Preprocessing steps for EEG. I got these codes from Jonah Elke, and made a few changes over years for different projects.

EEG Processing steps, are performed using the following Three codes:
MBSRPreprocessing1.m
	1) import EGI file to raw format
        2) add in channel locations from ModGSN-HydroCel-257.sfp
        3) lowpass filter
	4) highpass filter-
        5) adjust latency for the system delay
        6) import E-prime behavioural event file, and merge it into EEG data
	7) epoching based on stimuli presentation
	
Then based on visual inspection of signal, the following two steps are performed manually:
       8) Bad channels: look for noise
       9) Bad epoch: look for truncated blinks, drift, noise		

MBSRICAReliability.m	
This step is done based on Groppe, Makeig, & Kutas (2009), to create more objectivity in the ICA rejection process, especially given the noise in the dataset. In all cases except one, the ICA components are noise. 
	10) this script must be inside the ICA_reliability directory
	11) removes the vertex channel
	12) split the data into equal halves
	13) run icas on full data and each halves
	14) computes ICA reliability functions from Groppe, Makeig, & Kutas (2009)

Check all the reliable ICAs and discard them if they are noise

MBSRPreprocessing2.m
        15) interpolates missing channels
        16) re-references the data to the average
        17) baseline corrects

Manual epoch rejection

MBSRExporttoCSV.m
		- separates the conditions and saves .set and .csv
		- prints file name if number of trials <10
	1.8) ERP>Code>FixTargetafterTargetAccuracy.m
		- the code that exported the accuracy was incorrect and coded targetaftertarget incorrectly, this code updates it and fixes it

	1.9) Manually opened every condition file and noted the trial numbers (see trialnumbertests.xlsx)
		For other projects, I've written code to extract this info automatically, but I haven't for this project.

	1.10) Move csvs to local computer (ERP>OutputData>MBSR_export_files_redo) using rsync
